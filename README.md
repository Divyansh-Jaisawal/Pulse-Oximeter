# Pulse-Oximeter

A Pulse Oximeter is a medical device used to measure the oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and pulse rate of an individual's blood. It's a non-invasive and painless method commonly used in healthcare settings to monitor oxygen levels, especially in patients with respiratory conditions. Below is a project description for creating a DIY Pulse Oximeter:

# Components Needed:

Arduino Board: Acts as the main controller.
Pulse Oximeter Sensor: Contains an infrared LED and photodetector to measure blood oxygen levels and pulse rate.
OLED Display: Display to show the SpO2 and pulse rate readings.
Connecting Wires: To connect the components together.
Power Source: Battery or USB power supply for the Arduino and display.

# Circuit Diagram:
Connect the Pulse Oximeter sensor to the Arduino according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Connect the OLED display to the Arduino using the appropriate pins (usually I2C communication).
Power the Arduino and display using a suitable power source.

# Programming:

Arduino Code: Write code to read data from the Pulse Oximeter sensor and display the SpO2 and pulse rate readings on the OLED display.

# Assembly:
Connect the components together according to the circuit diagram.
Mount the Pulse Oximeter sensor and OLED display on a suitable enclosure or platform.
Power up the Arduino and verify that the sensor is working correctly and displaying readings on the OLED display.

# Testing and Troubleshooting:

Test the Pulse Oximeter by placing it on your finger and checking if it displays accurate SpO2 and pulse rate readings.
Troubleshoot any issues with sensor connectivity or data accuracy as necessary.

# Enhancements:

Add additional sensors for monitoring other vital signs such as temperature, blood pressure, etc.
Implement data logging or real-time monitoring capabilities using a microSD card module or wireless communication.
Improve the user interface by adding buttons or a touchscreen display for interaction.

By following these steps, you can create a Pulse Oximeter project that measures blood oxygen levels and pulse rate. While DIY projects can be educational and fun, it's important to note that a professionally manufactured medical-grade Pulse Oximeter may offer more accurate and reliable readings for healthcare purposes.
